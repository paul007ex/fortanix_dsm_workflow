# Fortanix Secure Communication Script: Masterclass-Level Guide 🌟🔐

## Overview 📜
The **Fortanix Secure Communication Script** is a Python application designed to showcase secure communication workflows using the **Fortanix Data Security Manager (DSM)**. This script demonstrates how to leverage modern cryptographic techniques, including AES, RSA, and hybrid workflows, to ensure **confidentiality** 🔒, **integrity** ✅, and **authenticity** 🛡️ in message exchanges.

Whether you're a beginner in cryptography or a seasoned professional, this guide provides a step-by-step understanding of the script's functionality and how it aligns with cryptographic best practices. 🚀

## Features ✨
### 1. **Key Management in DSM** 🔑
- **AES Keys**: Symmetric keys used for fast, secure message encryption.
- **RSA Keys**: Asymmetric keys for secure key exchange and digital signatures.
- **Dynamic Key Handling**: Automatically retrieves or generates required keys from DSM.

### 2. **Workflows** 🔄
The script supports three cryptographic workflows:
1. **AES Workflow**: Encrypts and decrypts messages with a symmetric AES key. ⚡
2. **RSA Workflow**: Secures messages with RSA encryption and verifies them with digital signatures. 🖋️
3. **Hybrid AES-RSA Workflow**: Combines AES for efficiency and RSA for secure key exchange and verification. 🔗

### 3. **Secure Protocol Design** 📡
The script follows a **sender-receiver model**:
- The **sender** encrypts the message, signs it, and shares the AES key securely. ✉️🔐
- The **receiver** decrypts the key, verifies the signature, and decrypts the message. ✅📩

### 4. **Comprehensive Logging** 📝
Detailed, color-coded logs provide step-by-step insights into every operation, making the script easy to debug and understand. 🛠️

## Cryptography Fundamentals 🧠
### 1. **AES Encryption** 🔑
- **Symmetric Encryption**: The same key is used for encryption and decryption.
- **Block Cipher**: Operates on fixed-size blocks (e.g., 128-bit).
- **Mode**: CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode adds an initialization vector (IV) for enhanced security. 🛡️

### 2. **RSA Encryption** 📜
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
- **Digital Signatures**: Ensures data integrity and authenticity by signing messages with a private key and verifying with the corresponding public key. ✅

### 3. **Hybrid Cryptography** ⚙️
- **AES + RSA**: Combines the speed of AES with the secure key exchange capabilities of RSA.

## Code Structure 🏗️
### 1. **DSMClient** 🛡️
Handles authentication and interaction with Fortanix DSM:
- Initializes the client using the provided API key.
- Configures and authorizes DSM API instances.

### 2. **CryptoManager** 🔐
Performs cryptographic operations:
- **Key Management**: Retrieves or generates keys in DSM.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Secures data using AES or RSA.
- **Signing and Verification**: Ensures data integrity and authenticity.

### 3. **Workflows** 🔄
Defines pre-built workflows:
- **AES Workflow**: Demonstrates AES encryption and decryption.
- **RSA Workflow**: Uses RSA for encryption, signing, and verification.
- **Hybrid Workflow**: Combines AES and RSA for secure communication.

## Protocol Details 📡
### Advanced AES-RSA Workflow
#### Steps:
1. **Sender (John)**:
   - Encrypts the message using an AES key. 🔑
   - Encrypts the AES key with Priya's RSA public key. 📜
   - Signs the message using John's RSA private key. ✍️

2. **Receiver (Priya)**:
   - Decrypts the AES key with her RSA private key. 🔓
   - Decrypts the message using the AES key. 📨
   - Verifies the signature using John's RSA public key. ✅

#### Data Flow:
```plaintext
[Message (AES Key)] -> [Encrypted AES Key (RSA)] -> [Signed Message (RSA)]
```

#### Encapsulation Example:
```plaintext
Step 1: ["Hello Priya" (AES Key)]
Step 2: [["Hello Priya" (AES Key)] (John's RSA Public Key)]
Step 3: [[["Hello Priya" (AES Key)] (John's RSA Public Key)] + [Digest ("Hello Priya") Signed (John's RSA Private Key)]]
```
