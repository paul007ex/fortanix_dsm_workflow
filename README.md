# 🔐 Advanced Secure Communication Using Fortanix DSM

## 📜 Overview

This project demonstrates secure communication workflows using the **Fortanix Data Security Manager (DSM)** for cryptographic operations. It includes **three core workflows**:

1. **Basic RSA Workflow**: Asymmetric encryption and signing using RSA keys.
2. **Basic AES Workflow**: Symmetric encryption and decryption using AES keys.
3. **Hybrid RSA-AES Workflow**: Combining RSA and AES for advanced secure communication.

The project is designed to **educate newcomers to cryptography** and **Fortanix DSM** while showcasing a robust, real-world implementation of secure communication protocols.

## 🧩 Features

### 🔑 Key Management
- **RSA Keys**:
  - 2048-bit RSA keys for asymmetric encryption and signing.
- **AES Keys**:
  - 256-bit AES keys for symmetric encryption.

All keys are securely stored and retrieved from the **Fortanix DSM**.

### 🔒 Secure Workflows
1. **Basic RSA Workflow**:
   - Encrypt plaintext with the receiver's RSA public key.
   - Sign the plaintext with the sender's RSA private key.
   - Decrypt the ciphertext with the receiver's RSA private key.
   - Verify the signature with the sender's RSA public key.

2. **Basic AES Workflow**:
   - Encrypt plaintext with an AES key using **CBC mode**.
   - Decrypt ciphertext with the same AES key.

3. **Hybrid RSA-AES Workflow**:
   - Encrypt the message with an AES key (for efficiency).
   - Encrypt the AES key with the receiver's RSA public key (for secure key exchange).
   - Sign the plaintext with the sender's RSA private key.
   - Decrypt the AES key and message and verify the signature.

### 📋 Protocol Workflow Visualization

#### **Basic RSA Workflow**
```
[Message](RSA Public Key) → [Encrypted Message](Signed with Sender's RSA Private Key)
[Encrypted Message](RSA Private Key) → [Decrypted Message](Verified with Sender's RSA Public Key)
```

#### **Basic AES Workflow**
```
[Message](AES Key) → [Encrypted Message](AES Key)
[Encrypted Message](AES Key) → [Decrypted Message]
```

#### **Hybrid RSA-AES Workflow**
```
Step 1: Encrypt message with AES key:
[Message](AES Key)

Step 2: Encrypt AES key with RSA:
[[Message](AES Key)](Receiver's RSA Public Key)

Step 3: Sign message with RSA:
[[[Message](AES Key)](Receiver's RSA Public Key)] + [Digest(Message)](Signed with Sender's RSA Private Key)

Decryption reverses this process, with AES key decryption and message signature verification.
